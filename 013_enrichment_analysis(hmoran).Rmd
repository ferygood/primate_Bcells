```{r}
library(clusterProfiler)
library(enrichplot)
library(ggplot2)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
```


Preparing Data:
a csv file containing a list of gene names and log2 fold change values.
We first try to analyze human and orangutan:
```{r}
dfhmchimp <- read.csv("hmoran_results/geneDESeq2results.csv")

# we want the log2 fold change
original_gene_list <- dfhmchimp$log2FoldChange

# name the vector
names(original_gene_list) <- rownames(dfhmchimp)

# omit any NA values
gene_list <- na.omit(original_gene_list)

# sort the list in decreasing order
gene_list <- sort(gene_list, decreasing = TRUE)

```

Gene Set Enrichment
you can access keytype using `keytypes(org.Hs.eg.db)`

```{r}
gse <- gseGO(geneList = gene_list,
             ont = "ALL",
             keyType = "ENSEMBL",
             nPerm=10000,
             minGSSize = 3,
             maxGSSize = 800,
             pvalueCutoff = 0.05,
             verbose = TRUE,
             OrgDb = "org.Hs.eg.db",
             pAdjustMethod = "none")
```


```{r}
require(DOSE)

#show category can be changed
dotplot(gse, showCategory=20, split=".sign") + facet_grid(.~.sign)
```
Enrichment Map:
Enrichment map organizes enriched terms into a network with edges connecting
overlapping gene sets. In this way, mutually overlapping gene sets are tend to 
cluster together, making it easy to identify functional modules.
```{r}
gseaplot(gse, by = "all", title = gse$Description[1], geneSetID = 1)
```

KEGG Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
```{r}
organism <- "org.Hs.eg.db"

# Convert gene IDs for gseKEGG function
# We will lose some genes here because not all IDs will be converted
ids<-bitr(names(original_gene_list), fromType = "ENSEMBL", toType = "ENTREZID", OrgDb=organism)

# remove duplicate IDS (here I use "ENSEMBL", but it should be whatever was selected as keyType)
dedup_ids = ids[!duplicated(ids[c("ENSEMBL")]),]

# Create a new dataframe df2 which has only the genes which were successfully mapped using the bitr function above
df2 = dfhmchimp[rownames(dfhmchimp) %in% dedup_ids$ENSEMBL,]

# Create a new column in df2 with the corresponding ENTREZ IDs
df2$Y = dedup_ids$ENTREZID

# Create a vector of the gene unuiverse
kegg_gene_list <- df2$log2FoldChange

# Name vector with ENTREZ ids
names(kegg_gene_list) <- df2$Y

# omit any NA values 
kegg_gene_list<-na.omit(kegg_gene_list)

# sort the list in decreasing order (required for clusterProfiler)
kegg_gene_list = sort(kegg_gene_list, decreasing = TRUE)
```
```{r}
kegg_organism = "hsa"
kk2 <- gseKEGG(geneList     = kegg_gene_list,
               organism     = kegg_organism,
               nPerm        = 10000,
               minGSSize    = 3,
               maxGSSize    = 800,
               pvalueCutoff = 0.05,
               pAdjustMethod = "none",
               keyType       = "ncbi-geneid")
```
```{r}
dotplot(kk2, showCategory = 10, title = "Enriched Pathways" , split=".sign") + facet_grid(.~.sign)
```
```{r}
gseKEGG_table <- kk2@result
head(gseKEGG_table)
```
### Pathview analysis
This will create a PNG and different PDF of the enrichnemt KEGG pathway

```{r}
library(pathview)

# produce the native KEGG plot (PNG)
# set pathway ID based on the table above
hsa <- pathview(
    gene.data = kegg_gene_list,
    pathway.id = "hsa04142",
    species = kegg_organism,
    kegg.native = T
)

knitr::include_graphics("hsa04142.pathview.png")

```
